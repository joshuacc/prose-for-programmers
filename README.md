# Prose for Programmers

This is a book for programmers.
It is a guide to mastering the most difficult programming language of all: human language.

Just as with programming,
we write with particular goals in mind.
That goal might be as simple as reminding someone about a requirement
or as complex as justifying an entirely new architecture for a product.
But in every case we write in order to achieve something.

This book will teach you how to achieve those goals more effectively with clearer, more persuasive writing.

## It is a work in progress

The first three chapters are content complete.

* [Why should developers study writing?](manuscript/why.md)
* [General Rules](manuscript/rules.md)
* [The Writing Process](manuscript/process.md)

And there are four chapters to come.

* Writing Structures
* Audience
* Genres
* Other Resources

For more detail, take a look at [the outline](outline.md).
