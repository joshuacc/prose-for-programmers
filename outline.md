        - [x] Laundry list of writing developers have to do
        - [x] Coding is writing
    - [x] I already know how to write. I did well in school.
        - [x] Literacy, even college level, doesn’t mean your writing is good

        - [x] Writing is a transferable skill
- [ ] Benefits
    - [ ] Better collaboration with teammates
    - [ ] Fewer bugs due to misunderstood code/docs

    - [ ] fewer back and forth emails/chats
    - [ ] More understanding/empathy from managers

    - [ ] Avoid ambiguity
    - [ ] Be precise
- [ ] Be organized
    - [ ] Human mind uses patterns to extract meaning
    - [ ] Structure is fractal: macro and micro mirror each other
    - [ ] Projects may come with built-in structure (API docs)
    - [ ] Several general purpose structures available
- [ ] Be scannable
    - [ ] Typographic structure to direct attention to ideas
    - [ ] Break up text into digestible chunks
    - [ ] Make use of bold and italic to highlight points
    - [ ] use headlines

## The Writing Process

- [ ] Determine the goal

    - [ ] What is their relation to the subject?
    - [ ] What is their relation to you?
    - [ ] Examples of how audience affects writing
- [ ] Choose a suitable structure
